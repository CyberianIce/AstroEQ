Version 7 includes a change to the microstepping mode being used. AstroEQ now uses 1/4 and 1/32th stepping modes for the DRV8825 chip. If you have legacy hardware, please read the "Upgrading from 6.x to 7.x firmware" file.

A small number of AstroEQ controllers are available to purchase. These can be bought from me on my website (http://www.astroeq.co.uk).

AstroEQ6 has been rebuilt from the ground up to be the best AstroEQ firmware to date.

There is also a redesigned set of hardware which no longer requires an Arduino Mega board to work. Instead it is based around an Atmega162 chip. Although this is not officially supported by the Arduino IDE, I have modified the bootloader to suit.
An advantage of this change is that now the board can be built using almost entirely through hole components, and can be made for much cheaper.

Please note that the new software still support boards built with the old hardware design (<4.0), so if you have already built one, you can still take advantage of the new software.

With thanks Chris over at the EQMOD Yahoo group for help communicating with EQMOD.

AstroEQ is an alternative to the expensive SynScan upgrade. The project acts as a gateway to connect the EQMOD Software (and hence ASCOM planetariums) to a motorised Equatorial mount that lacks Goto functionality.

The EQMOD Project can be found at: http://eq-mod.sourceforge.net/

  Works with EQ3, EQ5, HEQ5, and EQ6 mounts. Along With custom mounts.
 
  Current Software Verison: 7.0
  Current Hardware Version: 4.3
