AstroEQ Arduino code, and Hardware schematics.

AstroEQ is written and Designed by Thomas Carpenter 2012.
With thanks Chris over at the EQMOD Yahoo group for help communicating with EQMOD.

AstroEQ is an alternative to the expensive SynScan upgrade. The project acts as a gateway to connect the EQMOD Software (and hence ASCOM planetariums) to a motorised Equatorial mount that lacks Goto functionality.

As of current, I have got the firmware tracking at the correct speed.
It should work with most EQ mounts, including ones with custom gearing and custom stepper motors.

Getting the mount to track at the correct speed does require some calculation, but all is explained in the arduino file.
Also included are some example values for different Skywatcher mounts. These are untested, but should work in theory.
At the moment the only tested mount an EQ5 mount with the dual axis motor upgrade (non goto).

If anyone has success with the example numbers I have provided, please let me know.
Also if you have problems getting the numbers to work, open an issue thread and I will see if I can help.
