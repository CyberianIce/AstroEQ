If you are building an AstroEQ from scratch, a special bootloader has to be programmed to the Atmega162 IC in order for the configuration utility to be able download the lastest version of the firmware and configure the mount.

The bootloader HEX file is included in this folder.

If you have bought a Kit or ready assembled AstroEQ board directly from me, the bootloader has already been installed. You can skip this step and move on to the config utility.
If you are using an Arduino Mega board, you can also skip this step as they already have a compatible bootloader installed.
If neither of the above apply, please read on...

You will need to connect your programmer to the ISP pins which are shown in the schematic (The ISP header)
You will then need to the software that came with your programmer to download the hex file and set the fuses.

The following fuse settings should be used:

High Fuse: 0xD8
Low Fuse: 0xFF
Extended Fuse*: 0xFB   
(*If you programmer flags up an error on the extended fuse, use 0x1A instead)

I use 'avrdude' to program hex files. You can find a good tutorial for that here: http://www.ladyada.net/learn/avr/avrdude.html
