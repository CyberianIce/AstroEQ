Upgrading from 6.x from 7.1+:

There has been another important change in version 7.1 to the microstepping mode selection. It is now possible to select the exact mode you wish to use from a list.

This change has also lead to the unification of the Arduino Mega based versions, they are no longer considered legacy hardware. In order for this change to work, two new pins have been assigned to control the missing mode select pins to allow full control of which microstepping mode is to be used. The pin connections are as follows:

RA:
Mode 0 - Pin 15
Mode 1 - Pin 16
Mode 2 - Pin 17

Dec:
Mode 0 - Pin 20
Mode 1 - Pin 19
Mode 2 - Pin 18

If you are using an Arduino Mega, please make the changes required. If you are using an Atmega162 variety (as with all purchased controllers), no changes are required.
This is a bit of a pain for those using Arduinos, but rest assured, it is the last hardware change and has been done to bring the legacy design up to date.
