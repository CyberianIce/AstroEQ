The hardware and schematics are for reference only. At the moment, the PCB is untested - though I will be getting one made at some point. 

The motor drivers are Texas Instruments DRV8824PWP, which are surface mount. However, any stepper motor driver IC which uses 1/16th microstepping, and also which uses Step and Direction pins can be used, though it is up to you to modify the circuit accordingly.

If you are going to redesign your own, make sure to use the arduino pins I have used for step, direction, enable. Also use the same arduino pins for reset as I have if your IC has a reset pin.
The error pin is not so important, as there is nothing in the code which uses it. This may be added at a later date, so again if the error pin exists, connect it to the same arduino pins as I have.

It is possible to use 1/8th stepping, but it will require modification of the source code. If requested, I will add this feature.
